This is a simple image conversion program written in Java.

I've noticed there are several websites that will do this for you, however the
logistics seem silly to me. Upload file, convert it, download it back again...

So, I wanted to try just a simple program to do the conversion locally. I've
banged out a simple version in an afternoon, but I may work on enhancing it
further.

I don't expect anyone to ever read this, but at least I can test out how this
shows up in GitHub.

Cheers!
